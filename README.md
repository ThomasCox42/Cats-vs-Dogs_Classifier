# Cats-vs-Dogs_Classifier
#The newest version of Matlab (R2017b) is required to run the code in this folder.
In order to set up the cats vs. dogs dataset, you must partition the dataset into 2
subfolders labeled 'cat' and 'dog' with their respective pictures with the Kaggle
Training folder. You will also have to check to make sure that the image data store is
pulling from your correct directory. ALEXNET.m and VGG19.m are the main code files in 
this folder for setting up and training their respective models. This folder is a 
repository used for Oge Marques' CAP 4630-003: Intro Artificial Intelligence at FAU.
